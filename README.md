# customer-churn-prediction
### Churn prediction is essential for telecom as it helps you detect customers who are likely to cancel a cellular subscription, products or services. Churn prediction can be extremely useful for customer retention and by predicting in advance customers that are at risk of leaving.
### Unlike traditional averaging and guessing methods which donâ€™t give accurate result, we use predictive modelling and provide most results on churn rate most accurately, such that our customer Telco, can retain its customers.
